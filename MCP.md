# MCP (Model Control Plane)

This document outlines the concept of a Model Control Plane (MCP) as a potential future enhancement for managing AI interactions within the portfolio application.

## What is an MCP?

A Model Control Plane (MCP) is a conceptual architectural layer or service responsible for orchestrating and managing all interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI services. It acts as a centralized gateway between the application's frontend and the various AI models.

In the current architecture, the frontend communicates directly with the Gemini API. An MCP would introduce an intermediary layer to add more advanced capabilities.

## Core Responsibilities of an MCP

1.  **Model Routing & Abstraction:**
    -   The frontend makes a generic request to the MCP, not a specific model.
    -   The MCP can route the request to the best model for the job (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash` for chat, `imagen-4.0-generate-001` for image generation, or even a fine-tuned model). This makes it easy to swap models in the backend without changing the client-side code.

2.  **Prompt Management & Templating:**
    -   Centralize the storage and versioning of prompts and system instructions.
    -   Dynamically insert data into prompt templates before sending them to the model. This is useful for A/B testing different prompts to see which performs better.

3.  **Security & Credential Management:**
    -   The MCP securely stores all API keys. The client-side application never has access to these keys, significantly improving security.
    -   It can enforce authentication and authorization, ensuring only legitimate requests are processed.

4.  **Caching & Performance:**
    -   Implement a caching layer to store responses for common queries. This reduces latency and lowers API costs. For example, if many users ask "What is the AI Resume Analyzer?", the answer can be served from the cache after the first request.

5.  **Logging, Monitoring & Analytics:**
    -   Log all requests and responses for debugging and analysis.
    -   Track key metrics like response time, cost per query, and common user questions. This data is invaluable for improving the AI's performance and user experience.

6.  **Guardrails & Content Moderation:**
    -   Implement pre-processing and post-processing steps to filter out inappropriate content, enforce brand safety, and ensure the AI's responses align with predefined guidelines.

## MCP in the Context of the AI Portfolio

Implementing an MCP for this project would involve creating a backend service (e.g., using Node.js and Express, or serverless functions).

### Architectural Shift

**Current:**
`Frontend -> Google Gemini API`

**With MCP:**
`Frontend -> MCP Service -> Google Gemini API (or other models)`

### Benefits

-   **Enhanced Security:** The API key is moved from the client environment to a secure backend.
-   **Flexibility:** Easily experiment with different models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) or prompts without deploying new frontend code.
-   **Cost Savings:** Caching can dramatically reduce the number of API calls.
-   **Insight:** Analytics provide a clear picture of how users are interacting with the AI.

While a full-fledged MCP might be overkill for the current version of the portfolio, it represents a scalable, enterprise-grade approach to building and managing AI-powered applications.
