# From Direct API Calls to a Control Plane

The current architecture of this application involves direct, client-side calls to the Gemini API. While simple for development, this approach has limitations in security and scalability. A more robust, production-ready architecture would introduce a backend layer, sometimes referred to as a **Model Control Plane (MCP)**.

## Current Architecture: Direct API Access

`Frontend <-> Google Gemini API`

-   **Pros:** Simple to set up, no backend infrastructure required.
-   **Cons:**
    -   **Insecure:** The API key is exposed on the client side.
    -   **Limited:** Cannot securely connect to other tools or services (like a database or a private API).
    -   **Brittle:** Complex logic for choosing between different actions (like search vs. chat) lives on the client and can become difficult to manage.

## Future Architecture: Using a Backend Control Plane

A better approach is to use a backend that acts as a secure and intelligent bridge between the client and various AI models and tools.

`Frontend <-> Backend Server (Control Plane) <-> [Gemini API, Other Tools, Databases]`

### Core Responsibilities of a Backend Control Plane

1.  **Secure API Gateway:**
    -   The primary role of the backend is to act as a secure gateway. The frontend communicates only with your backend server. The backend, running in a secure environment, is responsible for making calls to external services like the Gemini API.
    -   This design ensures that sensitive API keys are never exposed on the client-side.

2.  **Tool Orchestration:**
    -   A backend is the perfect place to manage and orchestrate a suite of tools.
    -   Instead of the client having `if/else` logic, the user prompt can be sent to the backend. The backend, with the help of the Gemini model, can then determine the user's intent and decide which tool (e.g., database query, search API call) to execute.

3.  **Decoupling and Scalability:**
    -   By using a backend, the frontend is completely decoupled from the application logic. New tools or complex workflows can be added to the backend without requiring any changes to the frontend code. This makes the application highly modular and scalable.
