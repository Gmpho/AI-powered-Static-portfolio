## Feature: Thinking Mode for Interactive Chat

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing the "Thinking Mode" feature, covering all stages from understanding requirements to testing and deployment.

### 1. Understanding Requirements & User Experience (UX):

*   **Define "Thinking Mode":** What does it mean for the AI to be "thinking"? Is it showing intermediate steps, internal monologue, or just a "typing" indicator with more context?
*   **User Interaction:** How will users activate/deactivate it? What visual cues will indicate thinking?
*   **Value Proposition:** How does this enhance the user experience? Does it build trust, provide transparency, or help users understand AI reasoning?
*   **Edge Cases:** What happens if thinking takes too long? How does it handle errors during thinking?

### 2. Architectural Design & Technical Specification:

*   **Frontend (Vite SPA):**
    *   **UI Elements:** Design and implement UI components to display thinking states (e.g., animated dots, "AI is thinking..." messages, expandable thought bubbles).
    *   **State Management:** Integrate thinking mode state into `stateService.ts` (e.g., `isThinking: boolean`, `thinkingSteps: string[]`).
    *   **Communication:** How will the frontend receive "thinking" updates from the worker? SSE events?
*   **Backend (Cloudflare Worker):**
    *   **Gemini API Integration:** How will Gemini provide "thinking" steps? Does the Gemini API support intermediate responses or tool call planning? (This will require checking Gemini API docs).
    *   **Worker Logic:** Modify the `/chat` endpoint to process and forward thinking steps.
    *   **Tool Orchestration:** If thinking mode involves showing tool selection/execution, how will the worker expose this?
    *   **Rate Limiting/Guardrails:** Ensure thinking mode doesn't bypass existing security measures.
*   **Data Layer:** How will thinking steps be stored (if at all)? Temporarily in memory?

### 3. Security Considerations (DevOps & Cyber Security Engineer Hat):

*   **Information Leakage:** Ensure thinking mode doesn't accidentally expose sensitive internal prompts, API keys, or PII.
*   **Prompt Injection:** Can an attacker manipulate thinking mode to reveal internal system prompts or execute unintended actions?
*   **Resource Consumption:** Does thinking mode introduce new vectors for resource exhaustion (e.g., excessive logging, complex intermediate steps)?
*   **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation if thinking mode fails or produces unexpected output.

### 4. Implementation Plan (Iterative Development):

*   **Phase 1: Basic Thinking Indicator:** Implement a simple "AI is thinking..." message on the frontend, triggered by the start of a Gemini call. **[COMPLETED]**
*   **Phase 2: Intermediate Steps (if Gemini supports):** If Gemini provides intermediate steps or tool call planning, integrate these into the SSE stream and display them on the frontend. **[COMPLETED]**
*   **Phase 3: User Controls:** Add UI elements for users to toggle thinking mode on/off. **[IN PROGRESS]**

### 5. Testing Strategy (End-to-End):

*   **Unit Tests (Vitest - Worker):**
    *   Test worker logic for processing and forwarding thinking mode events.
    *   Ensure guardrails and rate limiting are still effective with thinking mode.
*   **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
    *   Verify UI displays thinking indicators correctly.
    *   Test activation/deactivation of thinking mode.
    *   Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in thinking mode.
    *   Test error scenarios (e.g., thinking mode fails, AI gets stuck).
*   **Manual Testing:** User acceptance testing to ensure the feature meets UX expectations.

### 6. Deployment & Monitoring:

*   **CI/CD Integration:** Update GitHub Actions workflows to include new tests and deployment steps.
*   **Monitoring:** Add metrics and alerts for thinking mode performance and error rates.
