# ✅ Capabilities

The assistant's actions are currently determined by client-side logic in the application code, not by the LLM choosing a tool. **AI responses are securely fetched via a Cloudflare Worker.** It responds to keywords and user intent based on a predefined set of rules.

*   **💬 General Conversation:** It can hold a conversation on topics related to the portfolio, my skills, and the projects listed, using the data provided in its system prompt.
*   **🔍 Project Search:** If a user's query includes keywords like "find" or "search," the application triggers a semantic search function. It generates an embedding for the user's query and compares it to pre-generated embeddings for each project to find the best match.
*   **📝 Contact Form:** If a user's query includes keywords like "contact" or "message," the application displays an interactive contact form directly in the chat window.
