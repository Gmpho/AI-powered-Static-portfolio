# 🛠️ Simulated Tool Contracts (Frontend)

The application simulates a "tool-based" architecture directly within the frontend code. The AI assistant doesn't decide which tool to call; instead, the application logic checks for keywords in the user's message and runs the corresponding function. **Note: While these are simulated tools, the actual AI interaction with the Gemini API is now securely proxied through a Cloudflare Worker.**

These functions are hardcoded in `index.tsx` and provide the data or UI for the chatbot to use.

## 📦 Project Metadata

Project information is sourced from `frontend/projects.ts` and passed directly to the Cloudflare Worker with each chat request. The frontend also implements client-side semantic search using embeddings generated by the worker.

- **🎯 Trigger:** Project data is sent with each chat request to the worker. Semantic search is triggered by keywords like "find" or "search."
- **📥 Input:** `{ projects: { name: string, description: string, url: string, tags: string[] }[] }` (sent from frontend to worker)
- **📤 Output:** AI response based on project data and semantic search results.

## 📧 Contact Email

Simulates sending a contact email and displays a contact form UI.

- **🎯 Trigger:** When the user's message contains keywords like "contact" or "send a message".
- **⚙️ Function:** Renders an HTML form in the chat window. When submitted, it calls a function that simulates an API call with a random success/failure outcome.
- **📥 Input (from form):** `{ name: string, email: string, message: string }`
- **📤 Output:** `{ status: "sent" | "failed", info?: string }`
