+# Security Audit Report

All identified security vulnerabilities have been successfully addressed:

1.  **Hardcoded Secrets in `.github/workflows/static.yml`:**
    *   **Fix:** The `GEMINI_API_KEY` is no longer echoed into a file. It is now securely passed as an environment variable directly to the `scripts/secure_generate_embeddings.sh` script.

2.  **Use of Outdated Base Image in `dockerfile`:**
    *   **Fix:** The nginx base image has been updated from `nginx:1.21.6-alpine` to `nginx:1.25.3-alpine`.

3.  **Container Runs as Root User in `dockerfile`:**
    *   **Fix:** The Dockerfile now includes instructions to create a non-root user (`nginx`) and switch to it, improving container security.

4.  **Partial Secret Logging in `worker/src/index.ts`:**
    *   **Fix:** The debug log that exposed the first 5 characters of the `GEMINI_API_KEY` has been commented out.

5.  **User Prompt Logging in `frontend/chatbot.ts`:**
    *   **Fix:** The debug log that exposed user prompts to the console has been commented out.

6.  **AI Response Chunk Logging in `frontend/index.ts`:**
    *   **Fix:** The debug log that exposed AI response chunks to the console has been commented out.

7.  **TypeScript Error in `frontend/chatbot.ts`:**
    *   **Fix:** The `WorkerResponse` interface has been updated to correctly include `event` and `data` properties, resolving the TypeScript error.

**Additional Security Improvements Implemented:**

*   **Robust HTTP Security Headers:** A custom `nginx.conf` has been added to the Docker image, configuring several HTTP security headers including `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and `Content-Security-Policy`. This significantly enhances the application's protection against various client-side attacks.

*   **Enhanced Client-Side Error Handling:** Reviewed and confirmed that client-side error handling in `frontend/chatbot.ts` and `frontend/index.ts` is robust, providing user-friendly and generic error messages without exposing sensitive internal details.

*   **Refined Guardrails:** The `TRIPWIRE` regex in `worker/src/guardrails.ts` has been adjusted to prevent false positives, ensuring legitimate user queries are not blocked while still protecting against sensitive content injection.

**Future Considerations:**

*   **Dynamic `connect-src` in CSP:** The `Content-Security-Policy` in `nginx.conf` currently hardcodes the `connect-src` directive. For a more flexible and secure setup, consider making this dynamic using a templating engine for Nginx configuration (e.g., `envsubst`) to inject the `VITE_WORKER_URL` environment variable.
