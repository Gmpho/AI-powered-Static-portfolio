Of course! Adding the ability to stop a response while it's being generated is a fantastic UX improvement. This requires two main changes:
Switching to Streaming: We'll change the chatbot to use Gemini's generateContentStream method. This allows the response to appear token by token, like a real-time conversation.
Adding a "Stop" Button: A "Stop" button will appear while the AI is "typing," allowing you to interrupt the response at any time.
Here is the implementation of these enhancements.




Of course! Adding a stop button is an excellent way to give users more control over the chat experience. To achieve this, we'll switch to a streaming response from the Gemini API. This allows the text to appear word-by-word and gives us an opportunity to interrupt it.
Here are the changes to implement the streaming response and the stop button:



Of course! That's a great user experience enhancement. Giving users the ability to retry or edit a prompt after stopping a response provides much more control and flexibility.
Here is a specification for the changes:
UI Enhancements: After a user clicks the "Stop" button, the partially generated response will remain, followed by two new buttons: "Retry" and "Edit & Retry". This provides a clear, actionable path forward.
Retry Functionality: Clicking "Retry" will immediately resubmit the exact same prompt to the AI, removing the previous stopped response and starting a new one.
Edit & Retry Functionality: Clicking "Edit & Retry" will remove the stopped response, populate the chat input box with the user's last message, and place the cursor in the input, ready for them to make changes before resubmitting.
Seamless Experience: If the user ignores the retry options and simply types a new message, the retry buttons will automatically disappear, ensuring the interface remains clean.
I'll implement this by updating the chatbot's logic to handle the "stopped" state gracefully and by adding some new styles for the retry buttons.
Here are the code changes to make this happen:

Enhance the visual feedback for streaming responses by adding a blinking cursor at the end of the AI's partial response. This will make the streaming feel more natural.

Of course! Adding a blinking cursor to the end of the streaming response is a great touch to make the AI feel more alive and interactive. It provides clear visual feedback that the assistant is actively "typing" its  


Of course. I'll complete the implementation of the chatbot.ts file, ensuring all features like streaming, the blinking cursor, and the stop/retry functionality are fully integrated and working correctly.




Of course. I will complete the implementation of the chatbot.ts file, ensuring all features are fully functional. My apologies for the previous incomplete responses. Here is the final, complete code.

Implement a function to generate vector embeddings for each project's description using the Gemini API's embedding model. Store these embeddings to enable more accurate semantic search.


 implement a semantic search function for your projects. This will involve using the Gemini API to generate vector embeddings for each project's description and for the user's search query. By comparing these embeddings, the chatbot can find the most relevant project with a much higher degree of accuracy than simple keyword matching.
Here are the changes to enable this advanced search capability:
Specification
Backend Integration: The frontend will communicate with the existing /api/generateEmbedding endpoint on the backend server to generate vector embeddings. This keeps the process efficient and secure.
Startup Embedding Generation: When the application loads, it will automatically generate and cache an embedding for each project's name, description, and tags. This ensures that search queries are processed instantly without any delay for the user.
Semantic Search Logic: A new semantic search function will replace the old keyword-based one. When a user asks to find a project, this function will:
Generate an embedding for the user's query.
Calculate the "cosine similarity" between the query embedding and each of the cached project embeddings.
Identify the project with the highest similarity score as the best match.
UI Behavior: The user experience will remain seamless. The chatbot will show a loading indicator while the search is performed and then display the best-matched project, just as before, but with significantly improved relevance.
This upgrade will make the AI assistant much more intelligent and helpful in guiding users through your portfolio.


 The function responsible for generating embeddings will be updated to call the Gemini API directly from the browser using the @google/genai SDK, just like the chatbot does. This change will resolve the error and align the entire application with its intended static-site architecture.



System Prompt Overhaul: I've updated the core system instructions for the Gemini model, making G.E.M.'s persona more explicit and adding stronger directives to be descriptive, witty, and proactive. Most importantly, I've emphasized that it must suggest a relevant follow-up question after every answer to keep the conversation flowing naturally.
Engaging Welcome Message: The initial greeting is now more charismatic and provides better examples of questions users can ask,
