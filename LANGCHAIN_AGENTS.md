# Agent Architecture and Future Enhancements

The "AI Assistant" in this project is a simple precursor to a more advanced AI "agent." An agent uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as a reasoning engine to decide which actions to take. This approach is heavily inspired by and could be evolved using concepts from frameworks like **LangChain**.

## What is an Agent?

An agent is a system that uses an LLM to:
1.  **Reason:** Analyze a user's request to understand the underlying intent.
2.  **Plan:** Break down the request into a series of steps.
3.  **Act:** Choose and execute a **tool** to perform a specific action for each step.
4.  **Observe:** Evaluate the result of the tool's execution.
5.  **Repeat:** Continue this process until the user's original request is fulfilled.

## How This Project Relates to the Agent Concept

The current implementation is **not a true agent** because the LLM does not choose the actions. Instead, the application uses simple `if/else` logic based on keywords to decide which "tool" (a client-side function) to run.

-   **LLM as Conversational Engine:** The project currently uses the Gemini API as a high-quality response generator, but not as the core reasoning engine for actions.
-   **Simulated Tools:** The functions for searching projects or showing a contact form are the equivalent of LangChain's `Tools`. They are discrete, single-purpose functions.
-   **Hardcoded Orchestration:** The application's `handleChatSubmit` function acts as a simple, hardcoded "Agent Executor." It is responsible for deciding which tool to run.

### Path to a True Agent

To evolve this project into a true agent architecture, the orchestration logic would need to be shifted from the client-side code to the LLM itself. This would involve:

1.  **Moving Logic to a Backend:** Create a secure backend server that can manage tools and API keys.
2.  **Describing Tools to the LLM:** Provide the Gemini model with a list of available tools and descriptions of what they do and what parameters they accept.
3.  **Letting the LLM Decide:** Prompt the Gemini model to respond with a JSON object specifying which tool to call based on the user's query. The backend would then execute that tool.

Frameworks like LangChain.js are designed to simplify this exact process, providing a robust structure for building powerful, tool-using agents.
