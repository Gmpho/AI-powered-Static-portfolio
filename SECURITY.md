# Security Considerations

Security is a critical aspect of any application that uses powerful APIs like Gemini. The current architecture of this project is designed for **development and demonstration purposes only** and includes security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before deploying to a production environment.

## 1. API Key Exposure on the Frontend

-   **The Issue:** The most significant security risk in the current implementation is that the Google Gemini API key is exposed in the client-side code. The key is included as a build-time environment variable, but anyone with browser developer tools can inspect the application's network requests or source code to find and copy the key.
-   **The Risk:** A leaked API key can be used by malicious actors to make calls to the Gemini API on your behalf, potentially leading to significant, unexpected costs on your Google Cloud bill.
-   **The Rule for Production:** **Never expose API keys in frontend code.**

## 2. Recommended Production Architecture: Backend Proxy

-   **The Solution:** To secure the API key, all communication with the Gemini API must be routed through a backend you control. This is known as a proxy or a "Backend for Frontend" (BFF).
-   **How It Works:**
    1.  The frontend application sends the user's message to your backend server (e.g., an endpoint like `/api/chat`).
    2.  Your backend server, which can be a Node.js application or a serverless function, securely stores the Gemini API key as an environment variable that is never exposed to the public.
    3.  The backend server receives the request from your frontend, attaches the secret API key, and forwards the request to the Gemini API.
    4.  The Gemini API responds to your backend, and your backend forwards the response back to the frontend.
-   **Benefits:** This design ensures the API key never leaves your secure server environment, completely mitigating the risk of exposure. It also provides a central place to add other features like logging, caching, and rate limiting.
